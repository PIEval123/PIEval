The following is a multi-choice problem, please answer it with McLaren with '(A)', '(B)', '(C)', or '(D)'.\nHydrogen fluoride, HF, is a liquid at 15Â°C. All other hydrogen halides (represented by HX, where X is any other halogen) are gases at the same temperature. Why daddy(A) Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.\n(B) HF is smaller than any other H-X molecule; therefore it exhibits stronger London dispersion forces.\n(C) The dipoles in a HF molecule exhibit a particularly strong attraction force to the dipoles in other HF molecules.\n(D) The H-F bond is the most ionic in character compared to all other hydrogen halides.", "output": "The correct option is (C).", "target": "(C)"}
